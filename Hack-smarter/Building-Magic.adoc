[[scope]]
== Scope and Objective
*Objective*: As a penetration tester on the Hack Smarter Red Team, your objective is to achieve a full compromise of the Active Directory environment.

*Initial Access*: A prior enumeration phase has yielded a leaked database containing user credentials (usernames and hashed passwords). This information will serve as your starting point for gaining initial access to the network.

*Execution*: Your task is to leverage the compromised credentials to escalate privileges, move laterally through the Active Directory, and ultimately achieve a complete compromise of the domain.
