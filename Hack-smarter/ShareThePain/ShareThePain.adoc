[[overview]]
== Scope
*Objective*: You're a penetration tester on the Hack Smarter Red Team. Your mission is to infiltrate and seize control of the client's entire Active Directory environment. This isn't just a test; it's a full-scale assault to expose and exploit every vulnerability.

*Initial Access*: For this engagement, you've been granted direct network access to the client's network. The door is open, but you're starting with zero credentials. From here, every move counts.

*Execution*: Your objective is simple but demanding: enumerate, exploit, and own. Your ultimate goal is not just to get in, but to achieve a full compromise, elevating your privileges until you hold the keys to the entire domain.
